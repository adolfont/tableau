# Tableau

My goal here is to implement the Analytic Tableau method and the KE method. 
Initially, only for classical logic.
Later, maybe for some paraconsistent logics.

Read more about the [Analytic Tableau method on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_analytic_tableaux).

Read more about the KE method on [my Phd. Dissertation](https://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/45/45134/tde-04052007-175943/pt-br.php).

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `tableau` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:tableau, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/tableau](https://hexdocs.pm/tableau).
