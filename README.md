# Tableau

My goal here is to implement the Analytic Tableau method and the KE method. 
Initially, only for classical logic.
Later, maybe for some paraconsistent logics (such as C1, as described in ["Towards an Efficient Prover for the C1 Paraconsistent Logic"](https://www.academia.edu/42085976/Towards_an_Efficient_Prover_for_the_C1_Paraconsistent_Logic)).

Read more about the [Analytic Tableau method on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_analytic_tableaux).

Read more about the KE method on [The taming of the cut: Classical refutations with analytic cut, by Marcello D'Agostino and Marco Mondadori](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marcello_DAgostino/publication/31089377_The_Taming_of_the_Cut_Classical_Refutations_with_Analytic_Cut/links/004635276879db86c1000000/The-Taming-of-the-Cut-Classical-Refutations-with-Analytic-Cut.pdf) [my Phd.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `tableau` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:tableau, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/tableau](https://hexdocs.pm/tableau).
